## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project (in it's current state) will be a simple PVP based roblox game with multiple maps, a point and shop system that allows the player to buy new weapons, and will also allow you to grab cool powerups that give u a small boost mid game.

TODO - Create shop system GUI, Create script and models for powerup systems, Fix maps.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Essentially, using roblox's built in game engine, Roblox Studio, my game will utilize both free range models and custom built models to create a PVP based experience. The Scripts used will vary very heavily in complexity from the main script which operates the games loop, point system and map choosing. To a simple script that maks a platform disapper. The main features will include a point based system for getting kills and suriving in game as well as a shop system to spend points on differnt weapons.
